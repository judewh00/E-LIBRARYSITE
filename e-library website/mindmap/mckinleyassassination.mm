      Written by Abraham Isaak: &quot;The attention of comrades is called to another spy. He is well dressed, of medium height, rather narrow shouldered, blond, and about 25 years of age. Up to the present he has made an appearance in Chicago and Cleveland. In the former place he remained but a short time, while in Cleveland he disappeared when the comrades had confirmed themselves of his identity and were on the point of exposing him... If this same individual makes his appearance elsewhere the comrades are warned in advance, and can act accordingly.&quot;

      The false name used by Leon Czolgosz when he introduced himself to Emma Goldman at Abraham Isaak's home, 1901. At the time, he claimed he had left Cleveland bc he did not care for the anarchists there and instead moved to Chicago to find comrades.

      Ran saloon where Czolgosz stayed before the assassination. &quot;A Pole, a sort of politician who has led his people here for years.&quot; He apparently thought Leon was going to the Fair and didn't know of the plot.
